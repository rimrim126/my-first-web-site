<h2>WEB?</h2>
<p>A web service description is a document by which the service provider communicates the specifications for starting the web service to the service requester. Web service descriptions are expressed in the XML application known as Web Service Description Language (WSDL).

The service description describes the web service in such a way as to minimize the amount of shared knowledge and customized programming that is needed to ensure communication between the service provider and the service requester. For example, neither the requester nor the provider needs to be aware of the platform on which the other runs, nor of the programming language in which the other is written.

A service description can conform to either the WSDL 1.1 or WSDL 2.0 specification. Each has differences in both the terminology and major elements that can be included in the service description. The following information uses WSDL 1.1 terminology and elements to explain the purpose of the service description.</p>
